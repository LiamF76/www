        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h4>
            Welcome to Daraan Games, the premier source for all your D&D supplementary needs! 
            Founded by an unlikely team of three raccoons in a trench coat pretending to be a college
            student at Concord University, we bring you resources for your game that you can't get anywhere else!
        <h4>
        <h4>
            The brains (and paws) behind the operation, Rufus, Patches, and Sprocket, started this 
            venture in the back of a Sheetz after realizing their shared love of storytelling 
            and shiny objects. With an eye for detail and a knack for chaos, the trio has been 
            crafting unique monsters, homebrew maps, and magical items ever since.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            At Daraan Games, we believe that every game should be as unpredictable and exciting 
            as our own antics. Whether you're a seasoned Dungeon Master or a brand-new adventurer, 
            our resources are here to help make your campaigns unforgettable.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            Thank you for supporting our small but mighty team (seriously, we‚Äôre all under 3 feet tall). 
            Remember, the only thing more powerful than a dragon is a raccoon with a vision‚Äîand maybe 
            a Bag of Holding full of snacks.
